**Industrial Palette (Teenage Engineering + Braun)**

**Base — Monochromatic:**
- Primary content: High contrast (`.primary` — black/white)
- Secondary: Medium gray (`.secondary`)
- Tertiary: Light gray (`.tertiary`)
- Backgrounds: Off-white light / near-black dark

**Accent — Single Signature Color:**
- Recommended: **Orange** (`#FF6B00` light / `#FF8C42` dark) — TE signature
- Use for: Primary CTA, active states, selection indicators, key affordances
- Alternative: Your brand color, but **only one**

**Rule:** If you need a second accent, redesign. Multiple accents = visual noise.

**Dark mode:** Invert luminance, preserve hue. Orange stays orange.

**Color-coding (TE pattern):**
- Different functional areas can have distinct accent hues
- But within one screen: single accent only
- Color = function mapping, not decoration
