**Aesthetic Principles**

- **Industrial minimalism** — precision-machined feel
- **Ma (間)** — negative space as design element
- **Functional honesty** — form follows function
- **Strategic color-coding** — color = function mapping
- **Organic breathing animations** — life without distraction

**Mantras**

- "Less, but better" — Dieter Rams
- "Limitation as liberation" — Teenage Engineering
- "Designed to NOT be used" — Endel philosophy
- "There is no substitute" — Porsche (borrowed)
- "Good design is as little design as possible" — Rams principle 10
