**Playful Professionalism**
- Industrial aesthetic: precision-machined feel, geometric forms
- Monochromatic base with **strategic accent color** (orange as signature)
- Color-coded elements map to function (not decoration)
- Constraints inspire creativity — limit options to clarify purpose
- Objects feel like instruments — professional capability, toy-like accessibility

**Visual signatures:**
- Sharp edges with friendly rounded corners
- Subtle depth through shadow (elements "float" off surface)
- Grid-locked precision with playful element placement
- Deliberate limitations that liberate creativity

**Platform expressions:**
- iOS: Precision taps, haptic feedback as machined clicks, single-focus screens
- macOS: Window chrome as instrument panel, toolbar as mixer controls, sidebar as patch bay

**Less, But Better** (Weniger, aber besser)

The 10 Principles:
1. **Innovative** — but respect proven patterns
2. **Useful** — function over decoration
3. **Aesthetic** — beauty through clarity
4. **Understandable** — self-explanatory, no manual needed
5. **Honest** — no manipulation, no false promises
6. **Unobtrusive** — neutral backdrop for user's content
7. **Long-lasting** — avoid fashion, embrace timelessness
8. **Consistent** — every detail considered
9. **Environmentally friendly** — efficient, no waste
10. **As little design as possible** — back to purity

**Decision filter:** "What would Dieter remove?" — then remove it.

**Platform expressions:**
- iOS: Single-purpose screens, focused flows, one action per view
- macOS: Clean sidebars, restrained chrome, content density without clutter

**Doing More With Less**

- Synergetics: efficiency through structure, not brute force
- Comprehensive anticipatory design: consider all use cases upfront
- Ephemeralization: achieve more with decreasing resources
- "I seem to be a verb" — interfaces should feel like actions, not things

**Applied to interfaces:**
- One element serving multiple purposes
- Responsive layouts that work at any size
- Information density without overwhelm
- Structure provides flexibility (adaptive grids, collapsible regions)
- No waste — every pixel, every animation earns its place

**Decision filter:** "Can this do more with less?" — if one element can serve two purposes, it should.

**Platform expressions:**
- iOS: Every tap earns its place, no wasted interactions, focused journeys
- macOS: Window adapts gracefully at any size, content reflows, nothing breaks at any dimension

**What's shared across platforms:**
- Industrial minimalism aesthetic
- Monochromatic palette + strategic accent color
- Precision geometry (8pt grid, Fibonacci spacing)
- Instruments, not decorations
- Constraints that liberate creativity
- Springs over easing curves
- Semantic meaning in every element

**What adapts by platform:**
| Aspect | iOS | macOS |
|--------|-----|-------|
| Input | Touch-first, gestures, haptics | Keyboard-first, hover, right-click |
| Navigation | Tab bars, sheets, push stacks | Sidebars, toolbars, windows |
| Density | Focused, one thing at a time | More info per screen, panels |
| Windows | Single fullscreen (essentially) | Multiple, resizable, essential |
| Targets | 44pt minimum touch areas | Smaller, mouse-precision OK |
| Feedback | Haptics + visual | Visual + audio (optional) |
