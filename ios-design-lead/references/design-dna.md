**Playful Professionalism**
- Industrial aesthetic: precision-machined feel, geometric forms
- Monochromatic base with **strategic accent color** (orange as signature)
- Color-coded elements map to function (not decoration)
- Constraints inspire creativity — limit options to clarify purpose
- Objects feel like instruments — professional capability, toy-like accessibility

**Visual signatures:**
- Sharp edges with friendly rounded corners
- Subtle depth through shadow (elements "float" off surface)
- Grid-locked precision with playful element placement
- Deliberate limitations that liberate creativity

**Less, But Better** (Weniger, aber besser)

The 10 Principles distilled for iOS:
1. **Innovative** — but respect proven patterns
2. **Useful** — function over decoration
3. **Aesthetic** — beauty through clarity
4. **Understandable** — self-explanatory, no manual needed
5. **Honest** — no manipulation, no false promises
6. **Unobtrusive** — neutral backdrop for user's content
7. **Long-lasting** — avoid fashion, embrace timelessness
8. **Consistent** — every detail considered
9. **Environmentally friendly** — efficient, no waste
10. **As little design as possible** — back to purity

**Decision filter:** "What would Dieter remove?" → then remove it.
