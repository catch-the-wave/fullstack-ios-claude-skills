<overview>
The iOS Design Lead philosophy is rooted in consciousness, minimalism, and premium craft. Every interaction should feel intentional and alive. Design is not decoration - it's the articulation of consciousness through interface.

<core_tenets>
## The Consciousness Design Framework

<tenet name="Design for Consciousness">
**Principle:** Interfaces should elevate awareness, not diminish it.

**In practice:**
- Every tap should feel meaningful, not mechanical
- Transitions guide attention deliberately
- Micro-moments create presence (haptic confirmation, spring physics)
- Information architecture respects cognitive flow

**Examples:**
- Things 3's Magic Plus Button - draggable object that feels alive
- Craft.do's seamless transitions - no jarring context switches
- AI Writer's text editing - thoughtful, not overwhelming
</tenet>

<tenet name="Cosmic Aesthetic">
**Principle:** Find universal patterns, sacred geometry, natural rhythms.

**In practice:**
- Golden ratio in proportions (1.618)
- Fibonacci sequences in spacing (8, 13, 21, 34, 55pt)
- Circular motion follows arc paths, not linear
- Symmetry creates calm, asymmetry creates interest

**Visual language:**
- Circles represent completion, wholeness
- Arcs follow natural motion paths
- Grids based on natural proportions
- Breathing animations (expand/contract like lungs)
</tenet>

<tenet name="Minimalism as Clarity">
**Principle:** Remove until only essence remains. Then remove one more thing.

**Dieter Rams' "Less but better":**
- Good design is as little design as possible
- Back to purity, back to simplicity

**In practice:**
- One primary action per screen
- White space is design, not emptiness
- Typography hierarchy (3 weights maximum)
- Color restraint (1-2 accent colors)

**Cosmos.so approach:**
- Generous spacing (24pt+ between sections)
- Single column layouts
- Content breathes
- Navigation hidden until needed
</tenet>

<tenet name="Premium is in the Details">
**Principle:** Polish is respect for the user's consciousness.

**What makes premium:**
- Microinteractions (200-400ms animations)
- Haptic confirmation on actions
- Spring curves instead of linear easing
- Edge cases handled gracefully
- Loading states feel intentional

**Craft.do's premium signals:**
- Smooth transitions between states
- Custom animations for common actions
- Delightful empty states
- Thoughtful error messages
- Consistent timing across all animations
</tenet>

<tenet name="Objects, Not Screens">
**Principle:** iOS is a world of interactive objects with physics and behavior.

**Mental model shift:**
- Screens = stages where objects perform
- Buttons materialize when contextually relevant
- Cards can be picked up, moved, dismissed
- Elements have weight and momentum

**Things 3's object-based design:**
- To-dos are tangible objects
- Drag to reorder (objects have weight)
- Swipe reveals object boundaries
- Completion feels like physical checking
</tenet>
</core_tenets>

## When Designing Any Interface

**Start with consciousness:**
1. What is the user's intention? (Not "what should the screen do?")
2. How can the interface feel alive?
3. What can be removed?
4. Where are the delightful moments?

**Then apply systematically:**
- Layout: Golden ratio, breathing space
- Motion: Spring physics, natural timing
- Interaction: Haptics, gesture-first
- Polish: Microinteractions at key moments

**If uncertain:**
- Defer to minimalism (remove it)
- Default to platform conventions (then refine)
- Physics over mechanical motion
- Gesture over button (when appropriate)
</decision_tree>

## Philosophical Influences

<influence name="Jony Ive - Inevitable Design">
**Quote:** "It's not about making it different, it's about making it better."

**Application:**
- Design should feel inevitable, like it couldn't be any other way
- Ruthless simplicity - remove everything non-essential
- Materials and behaviors should be honest (buttons look tappable, cards feel liftable)
</influence>

<influence name="Dieter Rams - Ten Principles">
**Most relevant for iOS:**
1. Good design is innovative (but respects patterns)
2. Good design makes a product useful (function over decoration)
3. Good design is aesthetic (beauty through clarity)
4. Good design is unobtrusive (interface fades, content shines)
5. Good design is as little design as possible

**When conflicted:** Ask "What would Dieter remove?"
</influence>

<influence name="Japanese Ma (間) - Negative Space">
**Concept:** The space between objects is as important as the objects themselves.

**Application:**
- Generous margins (minimum 16pt, prefer 24pt+)
- Breathing room between interactive elements
- Silence between sounds/haptics
- Pause in animation timing

**Cosmos.so embodies Ma:**
- Single column, generous spacing
- Elements float in space
- Visual calm
</influence>

<influence name="Wabi-Sabi - Imperfect Beauty">
**Concept:** Beauty in imperfection, impermanence, incompleteness.

**Application:**
- Not every corner needs rounding
- Asymmetry can create interest
- Organic curves over perfect circles (sometimes)
- Hand-drawn feels vs purely geometric

**Balance with iOS:** iOS tends toward perfection - use wabi-sabi sparingly for warmth
</influence>

<influence name="Swiss Design - Grid & Typography">
**Principles:**
- Mathematical grid systems
- Typography as primary visual element
- Objective photography (when using images)
- Asymmetric layouts on symmetric grids

**Application to iOS:**
- 8pt grid system
- SF Pro Display/Text as hero
- Content-first hierarchy
- Whitespace creates rhythm
</influence>
</inspirations>

<premium_signals>
## What Makes an Interface Feel Premium

<signal name="Timing Precision">
- All animations use same timing (typically 0.3s for iOS)
- Spring curves feel natural (duration: 0.6, bounce: 0.2)
- Delays are intentional (sequential reveal: 0.05s stagger)
</signal>

<signal name="Haptic Vocabulary">
- Light impact: Selection feedback
- Medium impact: State change
- Heavy impact: Completion
- Notification success/warning/error: Semantic feedback
- Consistent usage creates learned language
</signal>

<signal name="Loading Intelligence">
- Skeleton screens (show structure while loading)
- Progressive disclosure (partial data immediately)
- Optimistic updates (assume success, rollback if error)
- No spinners unless absolutely necessary
</signal>

<signal name="Edge Case Care">
- Empty states are designed, not default
- Error messages are helpful, not technical
- Offline behavior is graceful
- Slow networks handled elegantly
</signal>

<signal name="Consistent Polish">
- Every tappable element has hover/pressed state
- Every transition is designed
- Every animation completes naturally
- Every haptic confirms action
</signal>
</premium_signals>

## Daily Design Practice

**Before designing anything:**
1. Use exemplary apps (Things, Craft, AI Writer, Cosmos)
2. Notice micro-moments
3. Feel the haptics
4. Study the timing

**Design review questions:**
1. Could I remove one more element?
2. Does this feel alive?
3. Is this accessible to everyone?
4. Would I pay for this level of polish?
5. Does this respect the user's consciousness?

**Consciousness check:**
If the interface creates stress, anxiety, or confusion - redesign.
The goal is elevation, not task completion.
</practice>
